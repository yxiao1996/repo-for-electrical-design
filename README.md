# repo-for-electrical-design
containing sample tasks' C for MCU and Verilog HDL code prepared for the electrical designing competition in the vacation
the tasks are as follow:
(1)PLL(phase lock loop): four independent loops each has its own resolution;(Verilog HDL)
(2)FFT on MCU: display FFT spectrum of input signal on TFT screen;(C for MCU)
(3)DDS DAC: auto gain control loop;(C for MCU)
